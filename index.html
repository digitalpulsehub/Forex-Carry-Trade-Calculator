                    <h3>How Carry Trade Works</h3>
                    <p>The Carry Trade strategy involves borrowing a currency with a <strong>low interest rate</strong> (Funding Currency) to purchase a currency with a <strong>higher interest rate</strong> (Asset Currency).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> Capture the "Interest Rate Differential".</li>
                        <li><strong>Daily Earnings:</strong> You earn the difference (swap) every day the position is held overnight.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Risk:</strong> If the high-yield currency devalues against the low-yield one, the capital loss can exceed the interest gained.</li>
                    </ul>
